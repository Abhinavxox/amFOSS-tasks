#Introspection:

###Why must we choose you?
I have been a tech geek since I was child. The idea of handling and manipulating every components through coding and building products really fascinates me. I’ve explored a lot of field in these 4 years. Now my goal is to expand this knowledge and do some projects more often. When I heard and learned about Amfoss, I knew this is the place I wanted to stay and grow in. I see my future map and in Amfoss I can learn as well as productize myself.

###What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I have explored web development and I will have perfected myself in that field and have  a full stack developing skill. I will have explored in ML. I got the basic idea of how everything works but I will be practicing and excelling on implementing this development. I will learn to manage my time with my studies, as well as give particular time to learn ML as well as web development.

###How would you contribute back to the club?
I assure you that I am a really hard working person and I will do whatever task is given to me. I will always be ready to give information or teach to another member. 

###Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Firstly, the idea of giving tasks which will show ones skills in learning and handling everything as well as help one to explore many fields of computer science is really amazing. These few weeks have really made me active and my progress has crossed limits. This has been a great experience and I know for sure that Amfoss is the club.
