## How I approached each task?

Task - 0: I was a great experience learning how to dual boot with windows. I watched a lot of videos on youtube then only proceeded.

Task - 1: I followed the instructions and the task was easily completed.

Task - 2: First I wanted to learn about the terminal commands and how everything works. Then i proceeded with the task and it was easy after that.

Task - 3: I had never tried hackerrank, first I found the task were not that easy, so i made mind to keep it as an additional task, but still did some questions.

Task - 4: I had never tried python before this, but it wasn't that hard. First I learned to make a cli app using typer and then i learned to get and filter the json data. I also took refrences from google.

Task - 5: First I took a one hour crash course on C programming. Then pull the program and in 5mins, the debugging was done. The was not functioning still so I got the whole idea of how everything is working and made some changes of my own and completed the task.

Task - 6: Flutter was the hardest task for me I guess. Firstly in the installation part I was lost, and I had difficulty with managing the android sdk path. But I restarted this project and installed everything perfectly. Then I took a crash course on flutter as well, and I used the given resources like main carousel and replicated the app.

Task - 8: This was the easiest task for me. I completed everything in 2 hours as I was familiar with Web environment.

Task - 9: I didn't waste too much time on this, I used bootstraps and compiled a full portfolio website.

Task - 10: Scratch was easy I already knew it so wasn't difficul. In week-1, I had to make stairs using array like in mario, I used string manipulation to make it. In week-2, I was hard coding this but I found out every char return their ASCII value as int. Then it was really easy for me. In week-3, I the election was bit tricky but solved it.

Task - 11: I wanted to display all my plans like making connection, being productive, growing myself in a single poster but this task turned out quite intresting.

Task - 14: I learned and took refrences from google but understood the concept of grep, string, find, etc.

Task - 15: FIrst I tried hard coding, and solved every question but the complexity was a problem, so I learned new algorithms with less complexity and solved the problems.
